# Vex-Moment
Some very cool n well-written autonomous code

This autonomous routine is written for the Tipping Point Vex competition on a custom built bot.
Starting from the bottom right corner of the ring, it grabs the Team Mobile Goal from the balance beam
and pushes it left one tile and one tile up. Then, it fetches the Neutral Mobile Goal closest to the bottom
of the ring and brings it into the scoring zone.
